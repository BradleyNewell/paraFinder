Search for paragraphs and sentences including a specified keyword in a given text file. Once a keyword is entered this script will return the whole paragraph/sentence with that keyword.

To make things easier, you can save the text file you wish to use this search on in the same directory as the script. Then when prompted 
enter your file name. However if it is not in the same directory you may provide the full path to the text file which will work just the same.
You do not need to state the file type since this software is designed to work solely with .txt files as it stands.
